#Program to Perform Set Operations
# Define sets correctly
set1 = {1, 2, 3}  # Use valid variable name and curly braces
set2 = {3, 4, 5}  # Use valid variable name and curly braces

# Perform set operations
union = set1 | set2  # Union of set1 and set2
intersection = set1 & set2  # Intersection of set1 and set2
difference = set1 - set2  # Difference of set1 and set2 (elements in set1 not in set2)

# Print results
print("Union:", union)  # Outputs: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print("Intersection:", intersection)  # Outputs: {3}
print("Difference:", difference)  # Outputs: {1, 2}
